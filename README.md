## Features

### Public Application
- User registration and authentication
- Product catalog and featured products
- Product detail pages
- Shopping cart system
- Checkout and order creation
- Order tracking
- User profile management
- Responsive mobile-friendly interface

### Business Logic
- Customer management
- Stock alert system
- Notification system
- Authentication system (username/password)
- WhatsApp notification logic for:
  - Automatic new order alerts for administrators
  - Order confirmation, shipping, and delivery notifications
  - Manual customer order status updates via backend administration tools (excluded from public portfolio build)
- Email infrastructure prepared using Brevo (AnyMail), currently disabled in application logic

> WhatsApp notification logic is implemented for both administrators and customers. Automatic administrator alerts are active, while customer notifications are currently triggered manually from the admin dashboard and can be fully automated with a production WhatsApp Business API provider.

> Email infrastructure is configured using Brevo (AnyMail) and is currently disabled in application logic to avoid requiring user email addresses during signup.

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root for backend configuration.

Example:

```env
# Django
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DEBUG=True
DJANGO_ENV=local

# Database (optional in development; SQLite is used if omitted)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname

# Allowed hosts (required in production)
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key

CALLMEBOT_APIKEY=your_api_key

# Email infrastructure (optional; currently disabled in application logic)
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@example.com
```

> This is a sample configuration. Replace the placeholder values with your own credentials.
>
> Only a subset of variables is required for local development. For example, if you are not using Cloudinary, CallMeBot, Brevo, or Google OAuth during development, those values can be omitted.
